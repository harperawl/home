### Hyphen
Legally, my name does not contain a hyphen -- or does it? I have several birth certificates with conflicting information. Currently, my government identification (passport, driver's license) does not contain a hyphen; however, I prefer to style my name with a hyphen in daily life.

## Education

### Elementary school
I attended Maplewood Elementary School for grades K-5. After my first two weeks in kindergarten, I was moved up to first grade, hence my age and grade today.

### Middle school
I attended Jackson Middle School for grades 6-8.

While in high school, I took one class at Portland Community College: MTH 261, Applied Linear Algebra I, with instructor Matthew Funk. I have also received a few credits from Dual Credit high school courses (namely, AP Micro/Macroeconomics and Intro to Health Occupations).

I will attend Oregon State University in the fall of 2025 as a first-year freshman in the Electrical and Computer Engineering major program.
